                        <h1>Audi R8 V10 Plus</h1>
                        <p>The Audi R8 is a mid rear engine supercar manufactured by Audi. Its second generation was launched on the market in summer 2015 and updated at the end of 2018. It is the only car in its segment that retains a naturally aspirated V10 engine (with 570 hp or 620 hp) along with the Lamborghini Hurac√°n with which it shares most of its elements, in addition to the V10 engine. The price of the Audi R8 starts at $ 400,000. The design of the second-generation Audi R8 was revised at the end of 2018 by modifying the aesthetics of its bumpers and the front grille, adding an extra touch of aggressiveness as seen by other models of the brand updated at the same time as the Audi A1. However, the R8 continues to maintain the philosophy of offering a sporty aesthetic, but at the same time elegant.
