                        <h1>Renault Clio v6 Sport</h1>
                        <p>Renault Clio V6 was equipped with a V6 block placed in rear center position, developing 230 horsepower. Perhaps it may seem an exaggeration to install such an engine in such a small car, but the truth is that the French firm from the beginning thought of this car as something very close to the competitions, but that it was legal to circulate on the street. The Renault Clio V6, which for many was an approximation of the Clio Trophy, had a 6-speed manual transmission, and various elements aimed at improving handling and aesthetics. Since it is a cult car, today it is very difficult to find an authentic Renault Clio V6 in good condition.</p>
